# SPAM DETECTION SYSTEM
This repository contains the implementation of a spam detection system developed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system is designed to classify emails or text messages as either spam or legitimate (ham).
# Features
1. Utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
2. Implements a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes classifier) to classify messages based on their content.
3. Provides evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the spam detection system.
# NLTK Usage
The NLTK library is employed for various text preprocessing tasks:
1. Tokenization: Segmenting text into individual words or tokens.
2. Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words (e.g., "the", "is", "and") that do not carry significant meaning.
3. Stemming: Reducing words to their root form to improve consistency in text analysis.
# How To Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies, including NLTK.
3. Run the provided scripts or integrate the spam detection system into your project.
4. Customize the system as needed for specific use cases or datasets.
